    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Recently I started using Oracle database 12c enterprise edition. Instead of using a virtual machine I choose to use Docker to install the Oracle database in MacOs Mojave. I’m going to introduce how to do that in a few simple steps below. 1. Install dockerDocker is a tool we can create, deploy and run applications by using containers. Docker containers is launched by running an image, which is an executable package contains everything you need to run an application. For example, the Oracle database we are going to install in the docker later is an image provided by Oracle company. Install docker is very easy; all you need to do register a docker account and download Docker for Mac. After installed docker in your Mac, use the account you registered earlier to sign in. 2. Install Oracle database in dockerThe Oracle database 12C(12.2.0.1) enterprise edition is available in Docker hub, and you can get the image running on Oracle Linux 7 in the here. After you got the image from docker hub, run the code below in terminal to pull/download the image into your local machine. 1docker pull store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1 It might ask your credentials for the first time, input your docker username and password. Then use docker image ls to list the image you pulled, the output should looks like below: 12RREPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE store/oracle/database-enterprise 12.2.0.1 12a359cd0528 19 months ago 3.44GB Now excuting the code below to start an Oracle database server instance: 1docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 1521:1521 --name OracleDB store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1 (You can replace ‘OracleDB’ to the name you want for the database.) Wait one minute then run docker ps in your terminal; you should see the container is running and status column shows ‘healthy’ like below. Otherwise, wait for few minutes then run docker ps again. 12CONTAINER ID IMAGE CREATED STATUS 2065c157d818 store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1 3 days ago Up 2 days (healthy) The Oracle database is successfully running in your Mac now, now let us create a sample table and a database administrator account for it. Execute the query below to connect the database first. 1docker exec -it OracleDB bash -c "source /home/oracle/.bashrc; sqlplus /nolog" The output from your terminal should looks likes below: 1SQL*Plus: Release 12.2.0.1.0 Production on Wed Mar 13 01:55:16 2019 Copyright (c) 1982, 2016, Oracle. All rights reserved. Now execute the query below to create a new database administrator account and a sample table. 123456789conn sys as sysdba;-- Now enter the password as 'Oradoc_db1'alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;-- Create a new user name is 'DBadmin', and password is 'DBadmin'create user DBadmin identified by DBadmin;-- Grant privilege to DBadminGRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA TO DBadmin;--Create a sample table.create table Sample (id int,name varchar2(20)); Now the account and table are created, you can use SELECT USERNAME FROM DBA_USERS; to check. 3. Connect database with SQLDeveloperSQLDeveloper is an integrated development environment for working with SQL in Oracle databases with GUI; you can download it from here. After installed SQLDeveloper, click the green plus symbol in the left-top hand side to create a new connection. Use the information below to connect: Connection name Username Password Hostname Port Service name OracleDB DBadmin DBadmin localhost 1521 ORCLCDB.localdomain If the service name is wrong, try to execute select value from v$parameter where name=&#39;service_names&#39;; in the terminal to get the correct service name.]]></content>
